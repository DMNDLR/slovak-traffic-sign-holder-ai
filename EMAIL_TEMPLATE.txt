Hi [Colleague's Name],

I've created a tool that automatically translates Slovak articles to Czech, and I'm sharing it with you!

üéØ WHAT IT DOES:
- Takes any Slovak article URL (like from softwareshop.sk)
- Translates everything to Czech automatically  
- Downloads all images
- Creates clean HTML ready for your website
- Fixes all formatting and spacing

üì¶ HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Download the attached ZIP file
2. Right-click the ZIP ‚Üí "Extract All"
3. Double-click "START_TRANSLATOR.bat"
4. That's it!

‚ö° HOW TO USE:
1. Copy a Slovak article URL
2. Paste it in the translator window
3. Click "Translate Article"  
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Check the output folder that opens

üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY NOTE:
Windows might show a security warning - just click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

üìã WHAT YOU GET:
- Clean Czech HTML (copy into your CMS)
- All article images (ready to upload)

- Everything organized in folders

üÜò IF YOU NEED HELP:
